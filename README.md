# waggle Blade

Waggle Blades are standard, commercially available blade servers intended for use in a machine room, or extended temperature range telecom-grade blades. The Waggle platform supports blades with standard x86-64 CPUS and NVIDIA GPUs for AI@Edge compute jobs. As a Waggle Node, they run the complete Waggle software stack, and therefore can run Edge jobs, report data, and be remotely configured.
