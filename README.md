# Waggle Blade

Waggle Blades are standard, commercially available blade servers intended for use in a machine room, or extended temperature range telecom-grade blades. The Waggle platform supports blades with standard x86-64 CPUS and NVIDIA GPUs for AI@Edge compute jobs. As a Waggle Node, they run the complete Waggle software stack, and therefore can run Edge jobs, report data, and be remotely configured. The Waggle Blade OS and Software are available in our [repo](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/blade-image).
